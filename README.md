# workstation-salt-config
This is currently in a state of ongoing progress. I try to test everything before a commit/push but just know that this isn't stabilized yet.

This is for configuring my workstation with salt so that I have an automated setup any time I get a new PC or reinstall for any reason.
Currently supported is macOS and Fedora. I will be getting Ubuntu working soon as I am using some Ubuntu boxes for stuff here soon.

TODO: Add CrashPlan Installation state.
TODO: Come up with a better modularized organizational strategy for use with different types of machines
TODO: Build from source programs that bleeding edge is the best (vim)
TODO: ssh config file
TODO: Install salt from develop and set up environment
