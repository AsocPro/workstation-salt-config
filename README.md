# workstation-salt-config
This is for configuring my workstation with salt so that I have an automated setup any time I get a new PC or reinstall for any reason.
Currently the only thing supported is fedora. I will branch it out and add compatibility for other operating systems as I need/have time to. But my current focus is just fedora.
